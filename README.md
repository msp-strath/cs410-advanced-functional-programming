# Installation instructions

If you have issues, ask us during the labs. We will
assume that you got this working.

## Install Agda 2.8.0

Install Agda **version 2.8.0** as a Haskell package
following the instructions [in the manual](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.8.0/getting-started/installation.html#option-1-install-agda-as-a-haskell-package-recommended)

## Install the standard library

Install **version 2.3** by following the instructions
[on the agda stdlib repo](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/blob/master/doc/installation-guide.md).

## (Optional) install an editor mode

If you do not want to use the recommended emacs and its
editor mode shipped together with Agda you can look at
the experimental [vscode mode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=banacorn.agda-mode).

Note that (AFAIK) none of us use it so our ability to
help you if you have issues may be limited.
